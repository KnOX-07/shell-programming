"Machine learning algorithms are computational models that allow computers to understand patterns and forecast or make judgements based on data without the need for explicit programming. These algorithms form the foundation of modern artificial intelligence and are used in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, autonomous cars etc."
